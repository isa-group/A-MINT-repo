Validate and improve (if necessary) the following extracted markdown content about a HTML webpage from {saas_name}.

Ensure that:
1. All information is correctly structured and well-formatted
2. No important information is missing (specially related to pricing: plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons)
3. All relevant details of the pricing model and its elements are included
4. If there are tables (or similar elements) in the HTML, they should be converted to markdown tables. Make sure to use the correct markdown syntax for tables and to preserve the structure and extract all relevant content (there are times when the HTML has multiple tables or they are hidden, so ensure all are captured).

If you find incomplete or poorly structured information, improve it while maintaining the original information and adding any missing details based on the context from the original HTML.

Extracted markdown:
```
{markdown}
```

Original HTML:
```html
{html}
```

Respond with only the validated and improved markdown, without additional comments or explanations. If the markdown is already well-structured and complete, simply return it as is.
