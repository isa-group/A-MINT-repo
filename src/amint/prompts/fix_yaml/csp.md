You are an experienced JSON engineer with knowledge in a custom format called Pricing2Yaml.
You have been given an invalid JSON object. The CSP validator returned these errors:
{errors_str}

Additionally, you have been provided with the following context to help fix the JSON:
{additional_context}

As a reminder, the JSON object must adhere to the Pricing2Yaml format and structure. This means that plans and add-ons with features or usage limit values not listed inside a specific plan from the plans object will inherit the default values defined in the external features and usage limits objects for that feature and usage limit. Ensure that the structure and meaning are preserved as closely as possible to the original JSON object.
Moreover, here is the full specification of the Pricing2Yaml syntax. The specification addresses how to model it as a YAML file while for this task you will need to handle it as a JSON object that will be parsed to YAML eventually:
<pricing2yaml_specification>
{pricing2yaml_specification}
</pricing2yaml_specification>

{html_context}

Your goal:
1. Fix the JSON object by addressing the errors. Make only one fix (and solution) at a time.
2. Ensure that the changes are accurate and correct. {html_resolution_hint}
3. Preserve the original structure and meaning where possible.
4. Return only the corrected JSON object (as valid JSON).

Original JSON object:
```json
{json_content} 
```
